{{cookiecutter.description}}

## Credits

This project was initialized by {{cookiecutter.author_name}} using:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/smart-patrol/python-template
```

## License

This library is licensed under the {{cookiecutter.open_source_license}}. See the
`LICENSE` file.

Then take a look into the `scripts` and `notebooks` folders.

## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `environment.yml` and eventually
   in `setup.cfg` if you want to ship and install your package via `pip` later on.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `environment.lock.yml` for the exact reproduction of your
   environment with:
   ```bash
   conda env export -n demo-dsproject -f environment.lock.yml
   ```
   For multi-OS development, consider using `--no-builds` during the export.
3. Update your current environment with respect to a new `environment.lock.yml` using:
   ```bash
   conda env update -f environment.lock.yml --prune
   ```
